# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ToolChest!  All contributors and members are expected to follow the code of conduct defined in the `CODEOFCONDUCT.md` file.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Toolchest is an open source project I love to receive contributions from you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the toolchest itself.

# Ground Rules

This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of conduct, if you have one.
## Responsabilities
* Ensure that code is unit tested.
* Ensure that code is well formatted.
* Comment code where it makes sense to elaborate the reasons for blocks of code and logic.

# Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.

# How to report a bug
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Tool Chest, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Tool Chest has today have been added because I saw a need for it. Open an issue on my issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
I will look at Pull Requests on a somewhat irregular basis so please be patient. After feedback has been given expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks I may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.  Pull requests are rejected or accepted on my sole discretion.
